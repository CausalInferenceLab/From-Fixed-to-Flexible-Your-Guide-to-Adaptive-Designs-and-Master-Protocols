### Founded
-	Established in 1948 by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council
-	By a professor of Medical Statistics called Sir Austin Bradford Hill
-	The first trial was the streptomycin trial for Tuberculosis

### Sir Austin Bradford Hill
-	Advocates groups to be selected at random around 3 to 5 people at most
-	avoided using the term "randomization" in his 1937 handbook to encourage adoption by skeptical doctors.

### MRC Streptomycin trails
-	Conducted after WW2, when Tuberculosis was the leading cause of death 
-	Streptomycin, discovered in 1943 by Albert Schatz and Selman Waksman
-	Proved that bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that causes tuberculosis in the labs and animal study

### History of Adaptive Trials Designs
-	Initiated in 1985 with the effectives of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) WAS PUBLISHED BY Robert H. Barlett and colleagues in 1985

### ECMO
-	Procedure for newborns with respiratory failure
-	Faced challenges in terms of getting approval/consent

### Play-the-winner  
-	Clinical trial method based on ECMO
-	Introduced by Zelen 1969 and refined Wei and Durham in 1978
-	Treatment success is based on patients’ assignments= e.g. Patient 1 = treatment A or B. If treatment A is successful then the next patient = treatment A, else next patient = treatment B or other
-	Faced challenges in terms of ethical worry in terms of withholding lifesaving treatments

### Two-stage approach
-	Adaptive clinical trials
-	Done by the Bartlett et al. study, Pearl O’Rourke and colleagues
		-	1st stage –equal assigned to ECMO or standard-of-care at until there were 4 deaths observed in either group. 
		-	2nd stage - assigned to the more effective treatment until statistical significance was reached.

### UK Collaborative
-	Addressed after criticism of both methods – play-the-winner and two-stage approach 
-	Randomized clinical trial using equal allocation between ECMO and the standard control with the maximum sample size of 300 newborns, stopped at 180 newborns due to the sufficient outcome
-	Started from January 1993 to November 1995
Development of Master Protocols
-	Master protocols – initially developed for oncology
-	Received support from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
-	Adaptable to multiple clinical indications and objectives.
-	Basket and umbrella trials are limited only to oncology but platform trials can expand beyond oncology for research
-	Platform trials e.g.covid 19 platform trials
