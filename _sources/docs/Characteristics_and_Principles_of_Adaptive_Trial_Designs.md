## Chapter 3. Characteristics and Principles of Adaptive Trial Designs

### Presenter : [Jeongsun Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sun-park-861272138/)

### Introduction
#### Conventional clinical trials = fixed sample trial design 
- A single analysis is performed when the determined sample size is reached 
- Plan and design the trial based on what’s available regarding population, interventions, outcomes, and other parameters - some degree of uncertainty exists
- The trials will be at risk if it is not planned or designed accurately
- Unplanned ad hoc modifications (amendment of protocol) are common

#### Adaptive trial design = flexible with data-driven approach
- Use accumulated (interim) trial data to modify aspects of an ongoing trial (pre-planned)
- Trials to be more responsive >> lower risks related to uncertainties at the planning phase
- Can be applied from phase I to phase III

### Unifying Property of Adaptive Trial Designs
#### Key factor of adaptive trial design
- Use of accumulating interim data in the form of the interim analyses 
- Pre-specified plan to adapt the design

#### Interim Analyses 
- “Comparative analyses”, “Unblinded analyses”
- Sometimes involves breaking treatment groups and comparing study arms for efficacy and safety
- Unbreaking the treatment groups is also possible (ex. Total events observed to re-estimate the sample size)

#### Flow of Adaptive Trial Designs 
- Planning phase
    - 1. Review background information (ex. Relevant clinical context, historical data, etc)
    - 2. Create realistic scenarios and run statistical trial simulations
    - 3. Discuss and repeat simulations until needed
    - 4. Finalize trial design
        - Establish a pre-specified plan for interim analyses 
        - ex. How the interim data will be used, who will perform the analyses, who will review the interim data, other statistical details
        - The interim analyses plan includes details on endpoint, statistical analyses, decision rules, timing and frequency of interim analyses
- Operating phase
    - 1. Enroll subjects 
    - 2. Go through the ‘burn-in period*’
    - 3. Conduct interim analyses
    - 4. Review the statistical rules if the target sample size is not met
    - 5. Adapt the protocol if required
    - 6. Determine if the trial can be terminated (ex. Target size reached, stopping rules are met)
    - 7. Conduct final analysis if ready
    - Monitoring for safety and adverse events must be conducted regardless the design of the study.

**burn-in period**:
: A pre-specified initial phase where patients are enrolled and assigned to treatments using a fixed allocation ratio (e.g., 1:1) before any adaptive analyses or changes to the trial design occur.

: The burn-in period aims to collect sufficient data to allow for reasonable precision and to minimize the risk of making inappropriate adaptations based on early, potentially noisy data.

### Advantages and Limitations of Adaptive Trial Designs
#### Advantages
- Allow the trial to adjust to information that was not available at the design stage 
- Statistical efficiency; Improve statistical power to detect true treatment effect 
- Ethical advantages; the treatment can be halted early if efficacy is not established - minimize the number of subjects exposed to the less effective treatment 

#### Limitations
- Increased flexibility in protocol design increases the statistical complexity
- Not possible to derive closed-form expressions - trial simulation is required for evaluation of statistical properties (ex. Expected sample size, type I error rate, statistical power)
- More time and effort is required to establish statistical planning
- High-quality data is required for interim analysis - put burden on sites participating the trial since additional training and education is essential to meet the demands for an adaptive clinical trial

### Principles of Adaptive Trial Designs
#### A Priori Evaluation of Statistical Properties 
- Regulatory agencies, ethics board, funding agencies require a priori evaluation of statistical properties (ex. Demonstration of expected type I error rate control)
- Complex trials involve several goals - therefore often be more multi-faceted 
- Various features of adaptive trials (ex. Considering sample size, type I error rate, power, other performance characteristics, estimated treatment effects, number of patients assigned to each group) will be evaluated using trial simulations
- Pre-specified plans should be clearly outlines in study documents (ex. Protocol, DSMB charter, SAP) - no ad hoc changes

#### Simulation-Guided Trial Planning
- Pros and cons can be determined by clinial trial simulation prior to selecting a specific design option or beginning the trial by enrolling subjects 
- Clinical designs doesn’t work like “one size fits all”
- All designs have advantages and disadvantages - it is important using simulation-guided design process to consider multiple design candidates during the planning phase to choose the design would work most effectively 

#### Proper Operational Oversight and Management
- High quality data that are as clean as possible must be entered by sites in timely manner to ensure interim analyses can be conducted properly - knowing the data can have impact on stake holders (ex. Sponsor, investigators, site staff, etc) therefore bias the study operations 
- Access to interim data is limited to minimize the operational bias and to maintain scientific credibility
