## Characteristics and Principles of Master Protocols

Presenter : [Sang Ho Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shstat1729/)

### Introduction
- Master protocol is a overarching protocol dealing with multiple research questions.
- In general, one research question requires one clinical trial.
- We need to answer multiple research questions utilizing 'Master Protocol' in a coordinated, efficient, and sustainable manner.
- There are issues with nomenclature of platform trials, basket trials, and umbrella trials.
	- We follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s definition.

#### Important Concepts and Terminologies of Master Protocols
- Basket trial : one or more interventions on multiple diseases
- Umbrella trial : two or more interventions on a single disease
- Master protocol : A single overarching protocol dealing with multiple intervention hypotheses.
- Platform trial : Allows addition of new interventions. New interventions were not pre-specified in the design stage.
- Procedures and plans in master protocol can be updated over time.
- Master protocol can be adaptive but adaptive design is not necessary.

### Motivation for Master Protocol
- Traditional classification of disease is based on clinical evaluation and histology.
- In modern approach, molecular classification utlizes genetic and other biomarkers related to therapeutic responses to targeted therapies.
- Traditional International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications and molecular classifications are combined.

- Performing clinical trials become complicated and costly. 
	- Recruting a molecular-defined disease population is difficult.

### Principles of Master Protocols

#### Common Screening and Trial Systems
- Numbers of genomic test procedures and patients screened will be greater than number of patients recruited.
- Accumulative total cost of genomic tests can be a substantial amount.
- Having a single protocol can result in screening efficient and reduction of trial cost.
	- Also, master protocol can improve operational feasibility in the trial.

#### Establishment of Standardised Operating Procedures (SOP) for Common Trial Infrastructure
- In clinical trials, establishment of SOP is essential.
- SOP : A guide for research staff (ex: administrative, clinical, data, laboratory, and pharmacy management and procedures)
	- SOP can prevent having important variations among different institutions.

#### Centralised Governance and Decision Making
- Adoption of a formal governance structure.
	- Composition of different committees should be outlined.
		- General membership and their roles and responsibilities.
- Having common governing committees can lead to fewer resources.
	- ex: Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
		- Require a large number of experienced personnel.
	- Having a single DSMB that monitor the progress of multiple sub-studies and interventions is more efficient than having multiple independent DSMBs.

#### SecondaryUse of Collected Data
- Master protocol enable collection of high-quality data, often in large quantity.
	- It can be utilized other researches than primary research question.
