# Basket Trials and Umbrella Trials

## Presenter : HeeSeok Yoo
## Introduction

- Biomarker-guided clinical trials have become a cornerstone of precision medicine.
- Basket and umbrella trials are types of master protocol trials using standardized screening and operating procedures.
- These designs aim to improve efficiency in evaluating targeted interventions in biomarker-defined populations.

## Basket Trials and Umbrella Trials

### Basket Trials

- Evaluate a targeted intervention across multiple diseases that share a common predictive biomarker.
- Patients with different tumor histologies (e.g., lung, breast, colon) are grouped together if they harbor the same biomarker.
- Can use single-arm or randomized designs depending on phase and objective.

### Umbrella Trials

- Evaluate multiple targeted therapies in a single disease, with patients stratified into biomarker-defined subgroups.
- Each subgroup receives a different intervention matched to its molecular profile.
- May include randomization within arms and often involve a shared control arm.

## Characteristics of Basket and Umbrella Trials

### Eligibility Criteria and Patient Grouping

- **Basket Trials**: Patients from different diseases are grouped by a shared predictive biomarker.
- **Umbrella Trials**: Patients with the same disease are divided into subgroups by biomarker status.
- Disease integration in basket trials assumes consistent drug activity across tumor types.
- Biomarker-based stratification in umbrella trials requires biological plausibility for each subgroup.

### Intervention Assignment and Control Group Choice

- Basket trials often assign a common intervention without a control group.
- Umbrella trials typically assign different therapies per subgroup and more commonly include control arms (e.g., standard of care).
- Use of shared control arms is encouraged for efficiency and comparability.

### Comparison Against Other Biomarker-Guided Trials

- Basket and umbrella trials follow master protocols with predefined subgroups and standardized eligibility criteria.
- Different from adaptive enrichment trials, which allow modification based on interim data.
- Centralized screening and infrastructure improve implementation and coordination.

## Key Design Considerations for Basket and Umbrella Trials

### Biological Plausibility

- Biological plausibility requires careful evaluations of existing clinical evidence and underlying biological assumptions.
- Ensures that targeted interventions are appropriate for the biomarker-defined population.
- Important to distinguish between driver mutations (causally linked to disease) and passenger mutations.

### Accuracy of Biomarker Assays

- Misclassification due to false positives or false negatives reduces statistical power and may lead to incorrect conclusions.
- False positive rates (FPRs) should be considered in trial planning, though often overlooked.
- Particularly critical in exploratory (phase II) settings for correct candidate selection.
- In basket trials, assay accuracy should be similar across tumor types.

### Biospecimen Collection

- Standardized biospecimen collection is essential, especially in basket trials involving multiple histologies.
- Sample quality, yield, and ease of acquisition should be consistent across tumor types.
- Even in high-throughput centers, biopsy yield (e.g., 70% for lung adenocarcinoma) can be limited.
- Liquid biopsy offers less invasive alternatives but must be validated and cannot replace histopathological examination.

### Biomarker Prevalence

- Biomarker prevalence affects the size of the eligible patient pool and feasibility of recruitment.
- Low prevalence may result in high screen failure rates and increased cost due to unnecessary testing.
- Recruitment strategies must account for biomarker distribution to ensure adequate sample size within study duration.

### Sample Size and Statistical Assumptions

- Sample size depends on trial phase and design (e.g., single-arm vs. randomized).
- In **basket trials**, sample size may be calculated for the overall cohort using a single effect size.
- This assumes a common predictive factor; heterogeneity in treatment effect can dilute efficacy signals.
- In **umbrella trials**, sample size is calculated per subgroup; common control arms are recommended when feasible.
- The predictive assumption must be valid—otherwise, an all-comers design may be more appropriate.

### Randomization

- Predictive factors influence treatment response; prognostic factors affect outcomes regardless of treatment.
- Without randomization, it is difficult to separate predictive from prognostic effects.
- Randomization eliminates selection bias and balances measurable and unmeasurable variables.
- Statistical adjustments may partially compensate when randomization isn’t feasible, but are limited by small sample sizes and only account for known factors.
- Thus, randomization is strongly preferred for validity.

## Conclusion

- Basket and umbrella trials are powerful tools for evaluating biomarker-guided therapies under a master protocol framework.
- Their design requires careful attention to biological plausibility, assay accuracy, biomarker prevalence, biospecimen logistics, and statistical assumptions.
- When well-executed, these trials enhance trial efficiency, reduce redundancy, and improve access to personalized treatment options.
