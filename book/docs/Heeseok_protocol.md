### Pre-Extubation Dexmedetomidine Switch Strategy(PEDSS) — A Master Protocol with Thoracic Surgery, ARDS, and Sepsis
 
### Administrative Information
-	Title: Pre-Extubation Dexmedetomidine Switch Strategy(PEDSS) — A Master Protocol with Thoracic Surgery, ARDS, and Sepsis
-	Trial registration: (ClinicalTrials.gov)[ClinicalTrials.gov]
-	Protocol version: Ver 1.0
 
### Introduction

#### Background and Rationale
-	Sedation strategies prior to extubation impact delirium incidence, reintubation rates, and recovery speed.
-	Propofol plus opioid (e.g., remifentanil) is common in ICUs but is associated with risks of respiratory depression, increased delirium risk, and delayed recovery.
-	Dexmedetomidine (Precedex) produces cooperative/light sedation with minimal respiratory depression, and may reduce delirium risk when substituted for propofol prior to extubation.
-	This platform–basket design aims to evaluate this switch strategy across distinct patient populations (thoracic surgery, ARDS, sepsis) and test a common primary hypothesis while exploring heterogeneity of treatment effect.
#### Evidence base (including propofol long-term safety)
-	Propofol is widely used due to its rapid onset, short duration, and titratability.
-	However, prolonged high-dose use (days to weeks) carries risk of Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PIS), which can cause heart failure, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction.
-	Other rare adverse effects include hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, and metabolic derangements.
-	Short-term use (24–72 h) at standard doses is associated with very low rates of severe adverse effects, and is considered safe in current international ICU sedation guidelines.
-	In this trial, the control arm will generally involve ≤48 h of propofol at standard doses; PIS and other serious adverse events are expected to be extremely rare, but safety monitoring will include hemodynamic parameters, metabolic markers, and CK.
#### Hypothesis
-	The Precedex switch arm will have a lower incidence of delirium within 72 h after extubation compared to the standard arm.
 
### Objectives
-	Primary objective: To compare the incidence of delirium (CAM-ICU) within 72h post-extubation between groups.
-	Secondary objectives: To compare reintubation rates, ICU length of stay (LOS), ventilator-free days at day 28 (VFD-28), pain/sedation target achievement, cumulative opioid use, safety, and laboratory changes.
 
### Trial Design
-	Multicenter, three-basket (thoracic surgery / ARDS / sepsis) platform
-	Two-arm randomized controlled trial, open-label treatment, blinded outcome assessment
-	Stratified randomization by basket, site, age, and sex
-	Primary analysis at platform level; exploratory basket-specific analyses with FDR adjustment
 
### Participants
#### Inclusion criteria
-	Age ≥60 years, invasive mechanical ventilation, ≥24h of propofol + remifentanil sedation
-	Planned extubation within 24h
-	Sedation target RASS -2 to 0
#### Exclusion criteria
-	HR <40 bpm, high-grade AV block, uncorrectable MAP <55 mmHg
-	Severe hepatic impairment
-	Inability to assess CAM-ICU, terminal care plan in place
-	Deemed unsuitable by investigator
 
### Interventions
#### Arm A (Standard Care)
-	Propofol at institutional standard rate + remifentanil
-	Continued until extubation
#### Arm B (Switch Strategy)
-	6–12h before planned extubation, stop propofol and initiate dexmedetomidine (0.2–0.7 µg/kg/h, no loading dose)
-	Adjust to RASS -2 to 0
-	Maintain remifentanil at minimal effective dose
#### Common to both arms
-	Rescue benzodiazepine use minimized
-	Stepwise dose reduction and stopping rules for hypotension/bradycardia
-	Analgesia-first approach
 
### Outcomes
#### Primary endpoint:
-	Delirium within 72h post-extubation (≥1 positive CAM-ICU assessment)
#### Secondary endpoints:
-	Reintubation rate (24h, 48h), ICU LOS, VFD-28
-	Sedation target achievement (RASS), SAT/SBT performance
-	Cumulative opioid dose (morphine equivalents)
-	Safety (AEs, SAEs), lab changes (CRP, cortisol, LFTs, BUN/Cr)
 
### Sample Size
-	Control delirium rate 35%, intervention 25% (absolute reduction 10%); α=0.05, 1–β=0.80 → 325 per arm
-	Allowing 10% dropout: 360 per arm, total 720 participants
 
### Data Management and Statistical Analysis
-	eCRF compliant with 21 CFR Part 11
-	Primary analysis: logistic regression (group, basket, site; covariates: age, sex, severity)
-	Time-to-event: Kaplan–Meier / Cox regression
-	Missing data: multiple imputation
-	Interaction analyses: Bonferroni / FDR adjustment
 
### Safety
-	DSMB oversight, stopping rules in place
-	Standard safety monitoring including CK, lipids, acid–base status (for early PIS detection)
-	Suspected PIS: immediate protocol discontinuation, treatment change
 
### Ethics
-	IRB approval at all sites prior to initiation
-	Deferred consent permitted per institutional SOP
-	Data confidentiality maintained via de-identification and encryption
-	Compensation for study drug-related injury as per institutional policy
 
### Appendices
-	Participant flow diagram
-	Assessment schedule (Gantt chart)
-	Drug titration and reduction algorithm
