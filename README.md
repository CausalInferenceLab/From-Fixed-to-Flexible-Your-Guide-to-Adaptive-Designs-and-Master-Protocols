> Welcome to **From Fixed to Flexible: Your Guide to Adaptive Designs and Master Protocols**!

This repository is a collaborative space for learning about and working with adaptive designs and master protocols in clinical trials. Our primary goal is to create and present a practical master protocol incorporating adaptive design principles. Traditional clinical trials often follow a fixed design, but modern approaches are embracing flexibility and efficiency.  Here's a quick introduction to the key concepts:

**Adaptive Designs:** These are clinical trial designs that allow for pre-planned modifications to aspects of the trial based on accumulating data. This could include changes to sample size, treatment arms, or patient populations, all while maintaining the trial's validity and integrity. Adaptive designs enhance efficiency by allowing trials to respond to emerging data, potentially leading to faster and more conclusive results.

For instance, one type of adaptation is extending the recruitment period. If the initial recruitment rate is slower than anticipated, an adaptive design might allow for a pre-planned extension of the recruitment timeline to reach the desired sample size, ensuring the study has sufficient power to answer its research question. Other common adaptations include changes to treatment arms (dropping ineffective arms, adding new arms), sample size adjustments based on interim efficacy or futility, and modifications to patient populations based on emerging biomarker data.

**Master Protocols:**  Master protocols are overarching frameworks designed to evaluate multiple treatments or answer multiple questions within a single, streamlined structure. They are particularly valuable for studying various therapies for a single disease (like in oncology) or a single therapy across multiple diseases. *Importantly, while master protocols are not inherently adaptive, they frequently utilize adaptive design elements to further enhance their efficiency.*  This allows for seamless transitions between different research questions and treatment evaluations within the same protocol.

**Precision Medicine and the Need for Flexibility:** In the era of precision medicine, we are increasingly focused on targeted therapies and understanding how treatments work in specific patient subgroups. This necessitates the ability to conduct simultaneous multi-clinical trials and efficiently adapt our research as we learn. Master protocols with embedded adaptive designs are ideally suited for this landscape, enabling us to investigate multiple treatments concurrently, personalize approaches based on patient characteristics, and accelerate the development of effective therapies.

In this repository, we are studying these powerful methodologies, particularly in the context of oncology, and aiming to develop and present a practical master protocol incorporating adaptive design principles.  However, our vision extends to exploring the broader application of these flexible approaches across diverse clinical trial settings. Join us as we move from fixed to flexible clinical trial designs!

## 🌟 Project Vision
"From Theory to Practice: Embracing Flexible Clinical Trials"

Our journey is to move beyond traditional fixed designs and actively implement adaptive designs and master protocols in clinical research. We aim to:

- **Deepen our understanding**: Thoroughly study the principles and practical applications of adaptive designs and master protocols. **To solidify our learning, participants will have the opportunity to summarize and present study materials to the group, potentially two or three times throughout the project.  To further share our knowledge, your presentation materials, prepared in Markdown format, will be published on our project's GitHub Pages.  Please ensure your **presentation materials** are original summaries and avoid direct copy-pasting from sources to respect copyright and develop your summarizing skills.** This will be a valuable way to deepen your own understanding, contribute to our shared resource, and share insights with fellow contributors and the wider community.

- **Create and contribute**: Develop a practical master protocol incorporating adaptive design principles and share it openly with the research community.

Join us in making clinical trials more efficient and responsive!
